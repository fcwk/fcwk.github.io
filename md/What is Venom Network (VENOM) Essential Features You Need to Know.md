## Core Features of Venom Network

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Consensus

Venom Network employs a **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** consensus mechanism, ensuring transaction finality even when some nodes fail. This fault-tolerant design maintains network integrity, though it may slightly reduce transaction speed during node failures. Similar to Layer 1 protocols like Aptos, BFT enhances reliability for mission-critical applications.

### Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM)

The **Threaded Virtual Machine (TVM)** enables asynchronous communication between accounts. By allowing smart contracts to execute simultaneously through message-passing architecture, TVM significantly boosts throughput compared to traditional virtual machines.

### Real-Time Scalability

Venom's multi-layer architecture (Masterchain, Workchain, Shardchain) supports parallel transaction processing. This design theoretically enables **100,000â€“1,000,000 transactions per second (TPS)**, addressing scalability bottlenecks faced by older blockchains.

### Security & Stability

The protocol prioritizes system-wide security through decentralized validation incentives. Validators are economically motivated to maintain network integrity, creating a robust defense against attacks.

### Cost Efficiency

Despite high throughput, Venom maintains ultra-low gas fees (under $0.00002 per transaction), making it accessible for both micro-transactions and enterprise-level applications.

### CBDC Compatibility

Venom supports Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) transactions, positioning it as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized systems.
