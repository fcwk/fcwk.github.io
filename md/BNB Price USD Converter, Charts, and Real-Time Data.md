## What Is BNB?

**BNB (Binance Coin)** serves as the native cryptocurrency of Binance, one of the worldâ€™s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Initially launched as an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token in July 2017, BNB transitioned to Binance Chain in 2019 as its native token. It further expanded its utility with the launch of **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)** in 2020, where BNB became the primary fuel for smart contracts and transaction fees.

### Core Use Cases of BNB
- **Transaction Fees**: Pay lower trading fees on Binance.
- **Smart Contracts**: Power decentralized applications (dApps) on BSC.
- **Token Burns**: Quarterly token burns reduce supply to enhance scarcity.
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Used in Binanceâ€™s DeFi products, NFT marketplaces, and launchpad platforms.

## A Brief History of BNB

BNBâ€™s journey began during Binanceâ€™s **Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** in 2017, raising funds to build the exchange. The tokenâ€™s migration to Binance Chain in 2019 marked a strategic shift, enabling faster transactions and lower fees. The 2020 launch of Binance Smart Chain solidified BNBâ€™s role as a **dual-chain ecosystem token**, competing with Ethereum in the DeFi space.

### Key Milestones:
- **2017**: ERC-20 token launch on Ethereum.
- **2019**: Migration to Binance Chain.
- **2020**: Integration with Binance Smart Chain for smart contracts.
- **2021â€“2023**: Regular token burns reducing supply by millions quarterly.

## How Does BNB Work?

Binance designed BNB with a **deflationary model**, initially issuing 200 million tokens. The company commits to quarterly burns using a portion of its profits, permanently removing BNB from circulation. This mechanism aims to **increase scarcity** over time, potentially driving value for holders.

### Token Burn Mechanics:
- **Automated Burns**: Binance introduced an automatic system in 2021, replacing manual quarterly burns.
- **BSC Transactions**: BNB is used to pay gas fees on Binance Smart Chain, similar to ETH on Ethereum.
