## Understanding Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Strategy  

**Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy** is a foundational approach in crypto trading. By investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, investors reduce exposure to short-term price fluctuations. This method leverages **time diversification** to smooth out market volatility, making it ideal for long-term holders seeking sustainable growth.  

Key advantages of DCA include:  
- **Risk mitigation**: Spreads investments across multiple price points.  
- **Discipline**: Eliminates emotional decision-making.  
- **Cost efficiency**: Lowers the impact of market timing errors.

### Methodology

- **Profit reinvestment**: Each cycle resets with principal preserved, excluding profits.  

### Key Findings  
| Halving Cycle | DCA Rounds | Final BTC Holdings | ROI (%) |  
|---------------|------------|---------------------|---------|  
| 2009â€“2012     | 156        | 15.6 BTC             | 295.6   |  
| 2012â€“2016     | 208        | 20.8 BTC             | 9.74    |  
| 2016â€“2020     | 208        | 20.8 BTC             | 170.03  |  
| 2020â€“2024     | 208        | 20.8 BTC             | 412.1   |  

**Insight**: Long-term DCA strategy outperforms short-term approaches during bull markets. The 2020â€“2024 cycle yielded a staggering **412.1% return**, underscoring BTCâ€™s appreciation potential over time.

### Annual Results  
| Year  | ROI (%)  | Market Context               |

| 2021  | +21.47   | Institutional adoption surge |  
| 2022  | -48.75   | Macro-economic downturn      |  
| 2023  | +112.5   | ETF speculation and AI hype  |
