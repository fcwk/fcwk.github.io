## Key Players and Market Sentiment  

The summit‚Äôs guest list reads like a who‚Äôs who of blockchain innovation.

## Bitcoin: Testing Critical Resistance Levels  

**Bitcoin** (BTC) bulls are cautiously optimistic as the asset closed within the daily TBO Cloud for the first time in weeks. Key metrics to watch:  
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** Neutral at 52, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  
- **OBV (On-Balance Volume):** Needs stronger inflows to confirm institutional buying.  
- **Resistance:** $96,000‚Äîa breakthrough here could accelerate gains toward $100,000.

### 4-Hour Chart Dynamics  
- **Short-Term Outlook:** BTC is nearing $96,000 resistance, but OBV divergence raises concerns. Sustained volume above 10-day averages is critical for a bullish reversal.

## Ethereum: Struggling for Direction  

Despite holding key support at $2,150, **Ethereum** (ETH) remains mired in a bearish trend. Weekly indicators paint a grim picture:  
- **CME Gap Resistance:** $2,623 must be breached to shift sentiment.  
- **TBO Cloud:** Re-entry above $2,500 would signal strength, but current price action suggests capitulation.  

### ETH/BTC Divergence Signal  
A TBT Bullish Divergence Cluster on the 4-hour chart hints at a potential 8% rally. Traders should monitor the $2,300 psychological level for confirmation.

### FAQ: Why Is Ethereum Underperforming?  

**Q:** Why isn‚Äôt ETH rallying with BTC?  
**A:** Structural weakness in its derivatives market and delayed upgrades (e.g., EIP-4844) have dampened speculative flows.  

**Q:** What catalysts could revive ETH?  
**A:** A spot ETH ETF approval in Q2 2025 or the summit‚Äôs endorsement of staking regulations could act as triggers.

## Stablecoins and Altcoin Rotation  

Stablecoin dominance dropped 3% recently, signaling capital rotation into riskier assets. Key developments:  
- **TOTAL3 Market Cap:** Excluding BTC and ETH, it‚Äôs nearing the daily TBO Cloud‚Äîa bullish sign for altcoins.  
- **OTHERS.D Index:** Broke resistance, indicating mid-cap alts (e.g., ADA, SOL) are gaining traction.  

| Asset       | 7-Day Change | Market Cap Rank |  
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|  
| Cardano (ADA) | -2.1%        | #8              |  
| Solana (SOL)  | +1.8%        | #5              |

### Altcoins to Watch  
1. **Solana (SOL):** OBV support holds despite pre-summit jitters.  
2. **XRP (XRP):** $2.50 resistance looms, with potential for a $2.93 retest.

- Allocating to undervalued altcoins with strong use cases.  
- Monitoring OBV and TBO Cloud dynamics for early trend signals.
