## Stohn Coin (SOH): A Decentralized Proof-of-Work Cryptocurrency  

Stohn Coin (SOH) operates as a peer-to-peer digital currency built on a decentralized, community-driven blockchain. It utilizes a **Script-based mining algorithm**, adhering to the traditional proof-of-work (PoW) model. Unlike many projects, Stohn Coin avoids pre-mined coins or centralized distribution, ensuring fairness and transparency from its inception.  

### Key Features  
- **Mining Mechanism**: SOH employs the **LWMA3 mining difficulty algorithm**, which dynamically adjusts difficulty to maintain stable block times and network stability.  
- **Infrastructure**: The ecosystem includes an open-source mining community, a blockchain explorer, and command-line interface (CLI) tools for advanced users.  
- **Supply Dynamics**: With a current circulating supply of **15,000,000+ SOH** and a hard cap of **40,000,000 SOH**, the tokenomics prioritize scarcity and long-term value. Mining rewards gradually decrease over time, aligning with Bitcoinâ€™s deflationary model.  

### Market Performance  
- **Price**: $0.028317 (24h change: +66.51%)  
- **Market Cap Rank**: #8831 (CoinMarketCap)  
- **Milestone**: Nearly **15 million SOH mined**, reflecting strong community participation.  

> **Expert Insight**: Stohnâ€™s commitment to decentralization makes it an appealing option for miners seeking alternatives to centralized ecosystems. However, investors should monitor hash rate trends and network adoption.
