## Introduction to Bitget's Multi-Asset Margin Mode  
Bitget, a leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 innovator, has introduced a groundbreaking feature called **Multi-Asset Margin Mode** for USDT-M futures trading.

## Strategic Benefits for Cryptocurrency Traders  
By eliminating mandatory asset conversion, Bitget's innovation addresses two critical challenges in futures trading:  
- **Capital Lock-Up**: Users retain ownership of preferred assets while accessing leveraged positions.
