## Understanding the XRP Ledger (XRPL)

The **XRP Ledger** is a decentralized blockchain designed for fast, secure, and energy-efficient transactions. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum (pre-2022), the XRPL uses a unique consensus protocol that eliminates mining, enabling near-instant transactions with minimal fees. This makes it ideal for cross-border payments and financial applications requiring scalability.

### XRP Ledger vs. XRP: Key Differences

- **XRP**: The native digital asset of the XRPL, used for transactions and network fees.
- **XRP Ledger**: The underlying blockchain infrastructure that records and validates transactions, supports smart contracts, and enables token issuance.

Think of the XRPL as the operating system and XRP as the fuel that powers it. The ledger also supports decentralized applications (dApps), stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), expanding its utility beyond simple value transfers.
