## FTT's Role in the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem  

FTT was the native utility token of the FTX exchange, offering users benefits such as discounted trading fees and staking rewards. However, following FTX's collapse in late 2022, its utility has shifted primarily to speculative trading.  

### Historical Use Cases  
1. **Trading Fee Discounts**: Users holding $100+ worth of FTT received reduced fees on FTX.  
2. **Collateral for Futures Trading**: FTT could be used as collateral for leveraged positions.  
3. **Staking Rewards**: Stakers earned a share of platform fees and additional benefits.  
4. **Token Airdrops**: FTT holders received periodic airdrops of newly listed tokens.

The price of FTT is heavily influenced by market sentiment. Positive developments, such as exchange listings or regulatory clarity, could drive demand, while negative news (e.g., exchange failures) may trigger sell-offs.  

### Speculative Trading  
FTT's volatility attracts short-term traders. Price swings often correlate with broader market trends, such as Bitcoin's performance or macroeconomic shifts.  

### Tokenomics and Burn Mechanisms
