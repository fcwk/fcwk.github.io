- The company operates at a loss in its legacy software business, reporting a **$1.1 billion net loss in 2024**.  

### BlackRock: Stability Through Diversification  

BlackRockâ€™s iShares Bitcoin Trust mitigates company-specific risks like debt or mismanagement. However, it remains subject to Bitcoinâ€™s inherent price swings and regulatory shifts.  

With **$43.61 earnings per share in 2024**, BlackRockâ€™s diversified revenue streams (fund management, advisory fees, tech services) ensure resilience even during crypto downturns.
