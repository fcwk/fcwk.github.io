## Security Measures: Protecting Your Digital Assets  

### 1. Cold and Hot Wallet Segregation  
OKX employs a dual-wallet system to safeguard user funds:  
- **Cold Wallets**: Offline storage for infrequently accessed assets, immune to online hacking attempts.  
- **Hot Wallets**: Online wallets optimized for high-frequency trading, protected by OKX's proprietary semi-offline signing service and multi-layered detection systems.  

Private keys are split across geographically separated servers, requiring dual authorization for access. This redundancy ensures even if one system is compromised, assets remain secure.  

### 2. Regulatory Compliance Across Key Markets  
OKX holds licenses from stringent regulatory bodies, including:  
- **Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA)**: Through its subsidiary OKCoin Japan, OKX complies with Japan's rigorous cryptocurrency laws.  
- **Malta Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFAA)**: Ensuring transparency and operational integrity in the EU-aligned jurisdiction of Malta.  
- **U.S. State Money Transmitter Licenses**: Facilitating legal trading activities across American markets.  

These certifications underscore OKX's commitment to operating within legal frameworks, offering traders peace of mind in an often-unregulated industry.
