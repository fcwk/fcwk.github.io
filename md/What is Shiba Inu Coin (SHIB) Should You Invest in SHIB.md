# What is Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB)? Should You Invest in SHIB?

## Understanding the Basics of SHIB

Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB) is a decentralized cryptocurrency launched in August 2020. As a meme coin, it quickly gained popularity by leveraging internet culture and humor associated with Dogecoin (DOGE). The project's mascotâ€”a Shiba Inu dogâ€”has become synonymous with community-driven crypto projects.

**Key Features of SHIB:**
- Built on Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token
- Massive circulating supply (589 trillion tokens at launch)
- Part of a multi-token ecosystem (LEASH, BONE, ShibaSwap)
- Community-governed with no official team backing

## How SHIB Operates

SHIB's functionality is deeply rooted in Ethereum's infrastructure. This blockchain choice provides:
- Smart contract capabilities
- Secure transaction verification
- Interoperability with DeFi platforms

Unlike Bitcoin's capped supply of 21 million coins, SHIB's massive tokenomics create unique dynamics. The team burned half of the initial supply to Whale wallets, creating artificial scarcity for potential value appreciation.
