## Understanding Immutable X (IMX)

Immutable X is a **Layer 2 scaling solution** designed to enhance the efficiency of **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** and **Web3 gaming** on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging advanced zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) technology, Immutable X addresses Ethereum's scalability limitations while maintaining security and decentralization. This platform enables users to **mint and trade NFTs** with zero gas fees, making it a carbon-neutral option for developers and collectors.

This approach generates cryptographic proofs (STARK proofs) that validate transactions on the Ethereum mainnet, ensuring security without compromising speed. The platform's REST APIs allow developers to integrate NFT functionalities seamlessly into their applications.

### Benefits for Ethereum NFT Ecosystem
1. **Scalability**: Overcomes Ethereum's 15 TPS limitation.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces transaction costs to near zero.

1. **Transaction Fees**: Paid by users for NFT trades.
2. **Staking Rewards**: Earned by participants securing the network.
3. **Governance**: Enables token holders to vote on protocol upgrades.
