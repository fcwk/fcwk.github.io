## Bitcoin Breaks $100K Barrier, Triggers Massive Liquidations  

On May 9, 2025, Bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time since February, sparking a market-wide rally that left **nearly 200,000 traders liquidated** with over $968 million in losses, according to data from Coinglass.

### Market-Wide Ripple Effects  

Bitcoin‚Äôs 6% daily gain catalyzed a broader crypto rally:  
- **Ethereum** surged over 20%  
- **Dogecoin**, **Cardano**, and **XRP** posted double-digit gains  

However, the rapid ascent triggered cascading liquidations, particularly among leveraged short positions. Over $840 million of the total losses stemmed from shorts, as traders betting on price declines were forced to exit positions amid the bullish momentum.  

## Mechanics of Crypto Liquidations  

A liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs account equity falls below the required margin level to maintain open positions. Key drivers in this event included:  
1. **Excessive leverage**: High-risk trades amplified losses as prices deviated from expectations  
2. **Market volatility**: Rapid price swings reduced liquidity, triggering automatic stop-losses  
3. **Structural imbalances**: Limited sell-side liquidity at critical price levels exacerbated gaps

## UK-US Trade Deal Fuels Investor Confidence  

A pivotal catalyst emerged from transatlantic negotiations:  
- **UK-US tariff reductions**: UK car exports to the US now face a 10% tariff (down from 27.5%)  
- **Agricultural concessions**: Expanded US food imports into the UK market  
- **Zero tariffs on ethanol**: Critical for US beer production  

This agreement eased trade tensions, bolstering risk-on sentiment that spilled into crypto markets. Analysts noted parallels between traditional equity rallies and crypto‚Äôs resurgence, attributing both to improved macroeconomic clarity.  

### Regional Impact Breakdown  

| Sector                | Pre-Agreement Tariff | Post-Agreement Tariff |  
|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|  
| UK Automotive         | 27.5%                | 10%                   |  
| Steel & Aluminum      | 25%                  | 0%                    |  
| US Ethanol Imports    | 5%                   | 0%                    |  

## US States Accelerate Crypto Adoption  

Concurrently, US states advanced crypto-friendly policies:  
- **New Hampshire**: Became the first state to establish a crypto reserve fund  
- **Arizona**: Approved legislation allocating up to 10% of public funds to Bitcoin and digital assets  
- **Salvadoran Expansion**: The country‚Äôs Bitcoin office announced additional BTC purchases to strengthen reserves  

Thomas Perfumo, Kraken‚Äôs global economist, remarked, ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs resurgence aligns with institutional repositioning toward risk assets. The $100K psychological barrier could signal stronger momentum for 2025.‚Äù  

## Expert Projections for 2025  

Financial institutions have revised their Bitcoin forecasts:  
- **Ê∏£ÊâìÈì∂Ë°å**: Increased Q3 target from $120K to $200K by year-end  
- **JMP Securities**: Predicts $150K by Q4, citing ETF inflows and halving effects
