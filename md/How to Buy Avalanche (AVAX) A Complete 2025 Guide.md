### Step 2: Complete KYC and Security Verification  

Most exchanges require **Know Your Customer (KYC)** verification to comply with regulations. This typically involves:  
1. Uploading a government-issued ID  
2. Submitting proof of address  
3. Facial recognition scans  

Enhance account security by enabling **two-factor authentication (2FA)** and hardware wallet integration.  

### Step 3: Deposit Funds  

After verification, deposit funds using:  
- **Bank transfers** (ACH or SWIFT)  
- **Credit/debit cards** (instant but higher fees)  
- **Cryptocurrency** (e.g., BTC or ETH to trade for AVAX)  

### Step 4: Purchase AVAX  

Navigate to the AVAX trading pair (e.g., AVAX/USD) and execute your order:  
1. **Market Order**: Buy at the current price  
2. **Limit Order**: Set a target price for future execution  

### Step 5: Store Your AVAX Securely  

Transfer AVAX to a **cold wallet** like Ledger Nano S/X or Trust Wallet for long-term storage. Avoid leaving large balances on exchanges due to security risks.  

## Calculating AVAX Investment Returns  

While cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile, investors can estimate potential gains using historical data. For example:  

| Initial Investment | AVAX Price | Value After 1 Year | Estimated ROI |  
|--------------------|------------|--------------------|---------------|  
| $1,000             | $18.14     | $1,300             | +30%          |  
| $5,000             | $18.14     | $6,500             | +30%          |  

*Note: This projection assumes a conservative 30% annual growth rate. Actual results may vary significantly.*
