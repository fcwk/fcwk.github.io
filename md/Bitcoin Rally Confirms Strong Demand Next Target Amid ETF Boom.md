## ðŸ“Œ Bitcoin's Record-Breaking Surge: Key Drivers

Bitcoin's recent **3.8%** 24-hour surge to **$111,875** marks a pivotal moment in its evolution. The rally coincides with surging ETF inflows and a broader crypto market rebound, with the **CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index** rising **4.74%**. Letâ€™s break down the catalysts:

### ETF Inflows: A Structural Shift
Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have become a cornerstone of institutional demand, amassing **$129 billion** in total net assets. Weekly inflows of **$1.6 billion** in May 2025 underscore sustained interest. This institutional adoption mirrors the early days of gold ETFs, signaling Bitcoin's transition to a mainstream asset.

### Macroeconomic Headwinds: Bond Yields and Debt Fears
Despite rising U.S. Treasury yields (10-year at **4.6%**, 30-year above **5%**) and concerns over a **$5 trillion** debt spike from fiscal policies, Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional risk assets. Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio of **234%** adds global context, pushing investors toward alternative stores of value.
