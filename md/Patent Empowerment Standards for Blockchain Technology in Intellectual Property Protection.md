# Patent Empowerment Standards for Blockchain Technology in Intellectual Property Protection

## Abstract  
The rapid development of blockchain technology necessitates a more scientific and refined protection system. To address challenges like ambiguous legal protection boundaries, insufficient protection intensity, and uneven technological progress across sectors, optimizing patent protection pathways within intellectual property frameworks has become critical. However, blockchain's integration into patent systems must align with fundamental standards: patent eligibility and substantive examination criteria. This study proposes relaxing patent eligibility standards while tightening substantive conditionsâ€”refining utility definitions, enhancing creativity assessment benchmarks, and clarifying auxiliary factors in creativity judgmentsâ€”to mitigate risks of overbroad patent protection.

## 1 Blockchain's Growth and Legal Protection Challenges

Blockchain technology, or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), operates through decentralized, trustless data transmission and storage mechanisms. Its evolution began with timestamps for digital files in 1997, gained momentum with Bitcoin's 2008 introduction, and expanded into sectors like cross-border payments, supply chain traceability, and smart contracts by 2014. By 2017, blockchain became a strategic focus for governments, driving advancements in industries ranging from healthcare to digital identity verification.

**Global Patent Competition**:  
- **2011**: U.S. initiates blockchain patent strategies.  
- **2013**: China sees its first blockchain patent applications.  
- **2019**: Over 18,000 global blockchain patent applications, but only 15% granted.  

This disparity highlights urgent needs for improved patent strategies. Key technical domains include data layers, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. Patents now serve as vital metrics for corporate innovation and industry competitiveness.

## 2 Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Protection Pathways

### 2.1 Commercial Secrets: Exclusivity vs. Technical Lock-In  
While commercial secrets protect undisclosed code, their weakness lies in vulnerability to reverse engineering. This conflicts with blockchain's decentralized ethos, particularly for public chains where open access is critical. Restricting source code access could hinder widespread adoption and innovation.

### 2.2 Copyright Limitations: Expression vs. Technical Innovation  
Copyright protects software expressions, not underlying ideas. Blockchain's functional aspectsâ€”like consensus algorithmsâ€”often lack the "originality" required for copyright. Databases created via blockchain face similar issues: copyright shields structure, not content, limiting protection for public chains.

### 2.3 Trademark Inadequacies: Symbols vs. Technical Substance  
Trademarks distinguish products but don't protect core technology. Terms like "blockchain" lack distinctiveness, requiring contextual restrictions for registration. This approach fails to incentivize technical advancements or prevent competitors from securing stronger patent protections.

### 2.4 Patent Law: The Optimal Framework  
Patents protect technical ideas, aligning with blockchain's innovation-driven nature. By exchanging public disclosure for monopoly rights, patents promote transparency and technological diffusion. However, challenges persist in defining patentable subject matter and balancing exclusivity with public access.

## 3 Patent Eligibility Standards for Blockchain Technology

### 3.1 Global Patent Eligibility Criteria  
Patent eligibility hinges on:  
1. **Technical Solution**: Must address specific technical problems using natural laws.  
2. **Industrial Applicability**: Must yield tangible, beneficial outcomes.  
3. **Exclusion of Abstract Concepts**: Pure algorithms or business methods without technical integration remain ineligible.  

**U.S. Approach**: The "machine-or-transformation" test and *Alice* decision emphasize avoiding abstract idea patents. For example, smart contracts combining code with traditional contract principles often fail eligibility tests.

**EU Approach**: Emphasizes technical character during creative step evaluation. The Enfish case validated database patents by demonstrating technical improvements in data storage efficiency.

**China's Framework**: Requires blockchain inventions to demonstrate technical integration (e.g., improved consensus mechanisms) and exclude purely financial applications conflicting with public policy.

## 4 Substantive Examination Conditions

### 4.1 Utility Requirements  
Blockchain patents must prove:  
- **Industrial Applicability**: Practical use in sectors like supply chain verification or medical records.  
- **Beneficial Outcomes**: Enhanced security, reduced transaction costs, or regulatory compliance.  

Example: A blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting system meets utility standards by enabling verifiable product provenance.

### 4.2 Novelty Standards  
Blockchain inventions must differ substantially from prior art. Aggregated innovations (e.g., combining existing consensus algorithms) require distinct technical implementations to qualify.

### 4.3 Creativity Assessment  
Creativity demands non-obvious technical advancements. Challenges include:  
- **Examiner Bias**: Post-hoc analysis risks underestimating R&D difficulties.  
- **Auxiliary Evidence**: Factors like commercial success or unexpected technical effects can bolster claims.  

**Global Practices**:  
- **U.S.**: *KSR v. Teleflex* emphasizes ordinary creativity in obviousness tests.  
- **China**: Requires technical synergy between algorithmic and hardware components (e.g., optimizing PoW mechanisms for energy efficiency).

## 5 Strategic Recommendations for Blockchain Patent Systems

### 5.1 Dynamic Patent Eligibility Adjustments  
As blockchain evolves (e.g., AI integration), eligibility criteria must adapt. Proposals include:  
- Expanding patentable subject matter for hybrid systems (AI + blockchain).  
- Clarifying standards for decentralized applications (dApps) and DAOs.

### 5.2 Enhanced Examination Guidelines  
- **Technical Synergy**: Require blockchain patents to demonstrate interplay between technical and algorithmic features.  
- **Creativity Benchmarks**: Train examiners in emerging technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and cross-chain interoperability.

### 5.3 International Collaboration  
Standardizing patent practices across jurisdictions to reduce fragmentation. Initiatives could mirror WIPO's blockchain patent pools or EPO's AI patent guidelines.

## FAQs  

**Q: Why are blockchain patents critical for innovation?**  
A: Patents incentivize R&D investment by granting temporary monopolies. They also facilitate knowledge sharing through public disclosures, accelerating industry-wide advancements.

**Q: What distinguishes blockchain patents from software patents?**  
A: Blockchain patents must demonstrate decentralized architecture integration (e.g., consensus mechanisms) beyond generic software solutions. Pure financial applications often face stricter scrutiny.

**Q: How can companies strengthen blockchain patent applications?**  
A: Focus on technical innovations (e.g., novel consensus algorithms), provide detailed implementation examples, and highlight measurable benefits like energy savings or transaction throughput improvements.

**Q: What role do standards play in blockchain patent strategies?**  
A: Standards ensure interoperability while creating "standard-essential patents" (SEPs) that grant market leadership. Collaborative initiatives like Hyperledger foster balanced IP ecosystems.

**Q: Are public blockchain projects patentable?**  
A: Yes, if they solve technical problems (e.g., scalability) through novel mechanisms. However, overly broad claims risk rejection for lack of specificity.
