## What Is DAO Maker?  

DAO Maker is an all-in-one platform that empowers investors and developers in the blockchain space. Its primary offering is the **Launchpad**, where users can discover and invest in early-stage crypto projects. The platform has facilitated the growth of notable projects like **Orion Protocol (ORN)**, **My Neighbor Alice (ALICE)**, and **Infinity Pad (IPAD)**. Beyond its launchpad, DAO Maker provides incubation services, risk-mitigation tools, and staking rewards, making it a hub for blockchain innovation.

## What Does DAO Maker Aim to Achieve?  

The blockchain industry is flooded with new projects, many of which fail due to lack of resources or trust. DAO Maker addresses these challenges by:  
- **Curating Projects**: Rigorous vetting ensures only credible ventures reach the platform.  
- **Protecting Investors**: Background checks and incubation programs reduce the risk of scams.  
- **Democratizing Access**: Retail investors gain opportunities typically reserved for institutional players.  

By fostering a secure environment, DAO Maker aims to become the go-to platform for early-stage blockchain investments.

## How Does DAO Maker Work?  

At the heart of DAO Makerâ€™s ecosystem is the **DAO token**, an ERC-20 utility token that unlocks access to its features. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its operational mechanics:  

### 1. **Staking DAO Tokens**  
Staking DAO tokens grants users "DAO Power," which determines their eligibility for project allocations. The longer you stake, the higher your rewards and chances of securing allocations.  

**Staking Tiers and Benefits**  
| Tier | DAO Staked | Max Allocations | Allocation Bonus |  
|------|------------|-----------------|------------------|  
| Level 0 | 250â€“1,999 | 1 | 0% |  
| Level 1 | 2,000â€“3,999 | 2 | 5% |  
| Level 2 | 4,000â€“9,999 | 6 | 10% |  
| Level 5 | 50,000â€“99,999 | 33 | 25% |  

### 2. **Participating in SHOs**  
Public SHOs allow anyone with $500+ in crypto to bid on projects. Private SHOs require a minimum of 250 DAO staked, offering guaranteed returns and exclusive access.  

### 3. **Risk Bill System**  
Investors fund projects via risk bills, earning returns when bonds mature. This system minimizes exposure to failed projects.  

### 4. **Social Mining**  
Promote projects on social platforms to earn rewards through airdrops.
